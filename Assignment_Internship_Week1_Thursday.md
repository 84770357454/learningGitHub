# Why this Mini-project?
A viral epidemic poses a threat to human life and the last resort to tackle it, on which the entire human race rely on, is the availablity of **drugs**. With varieities of drugs available to us, for example *anti-viral drugs, palliative drugs, antibacterial drugs and so on*, it has become difficult to track the role of the drug. While some drugs are proving to be effective antiviral there are drugs that only cure the symptoms. Hence, this miniproject provides the necessary tools that would provide complete information at one one place to the public.
## Objectives:
- [ ] *To create a dictionary consisting of drugs for viral diseases and its local name in different countries.*
- [ ] *Differentiate drugs that work directly against the virus and the drugs that only work on symptoms.*
